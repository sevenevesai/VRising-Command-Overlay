# VRising-Command-Overlay

**Visual command overlay for modded V Rising.**

An open-source, low-impact overlay for issuing mod commands in [V Rising](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604030/V_Rising/) via a simple in-game UI.

---

### Features

- Written in C# â€” runs natively as a Windows `.exe`
- Clickable buttons that send chat commands to the game
- Supports prompts with text input or option picklists
- Drag-to-reposition overlay anywhere on screen
- Backed by a user-editable `commands.json`
- Dynamic: just edit the JSON and restart to change the UI
